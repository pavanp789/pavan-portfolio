<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
I am a recent Computer Science graduate and trained Java Backend Developer
with a strong foundation in Spring Boot, RESTful APIs, and database-driven
applications. I enjoy designing clean backend architectures, implementing
secure authentication, and building scalable services. I have worked on
full-stack projects that follow real-world development practices and I am
actively seeking an entry-level backend or full-stack developer role.
